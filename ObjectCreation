//prototype pattern
//In javaScaript every object shares some common memory called prototype., for memory saving
//In this code we created function using protype, so if u write like this this function is stored in object 
//protype so that only one function will be created, If u create 100 objects only one function will created
//and that is shared among all onjects

var Employee=function(name,company,salary){
    this.name=name;
    this.company=company;
    this.salary=salary;
    if(typeof this.printinfo !=='function'){
        Employee.prototype.printinfo=function (){
            console.log(this.name+" "+this.company+" "+this.salary)
        };
    }
};

var Emp1=new Employee("Naveen","CTS",25000);
Emp1.printinfo();
console.log('printinfo' in Emp1)
console.log(Emp1.hasOwnProperty('printinfo'));
